################### CODING A FULLY FUNCTIONAL TODO LIST #####################
    -> Feature 1 : Adding todos (we will be using a todos array to fetch value from the input box and render it )
    -> Feature 2 : Deleting todos (we can delete a task in the todo app, incase the user wants to shift the task to some other day)
    -> Feature 3 : Editing todos (we should be able to edit the task, incase the user wants to change or add anything in the existing task
                    without deleting the entire task, here when user clicks on edit, there must be an input bar, with the previous task pre-typed
                    so the user can make changes quickly, meanwhile edit button would have been changed to save button, when user clicks on save
                    it should render the changes made)
